It seems that we g:Profile (a web app) to do GSEAS (why?) 
what is the benefit to us g:Profile.

There is an R package to connect to web server of g:Profile, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/366d/13569bcdbaef40cfd71ec49298e3da6ce50d.pdf. See the code examples in that link. Another R code example using gprofiler can be seen at https://sib-swiss.github.io/single-cell-training/day3/day3-2_enrichment_analysis.html

There is also an old Python API to g:Profile, but was outdated after the new version of g:Profile were released. We can find the python code to use the old API at 
https://github.com/scverse/scanpy-tutorials/blob/main/scanpy_workshop/day2_02_GeneSetEnrichmentAnalysis.ipynb

Note: clearly we can call to use g:Profile on bulk RNASeq. (but still why we want to use this instead of other tools like fgsea(??))
